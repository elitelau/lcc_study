// test.c
1   int f(void) {
2     extern int a;
3     return ++a;
4   }
5   
6   int a;
-------------------
a is added to `externals symbol table, with extern scope, in line2.
when declaration for a is visited again, relocate its symbol from `externals 
table to `globals table.
a.defined=1, when apply finalize() for finishing parse the source file.
and a.ref=1.0 since it's visited by "++a;" statement.
