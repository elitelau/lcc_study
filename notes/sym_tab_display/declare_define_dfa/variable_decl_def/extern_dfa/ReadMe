[extern global]: s1
[extern local]: s2

various dfa:

. extern global dfa
  s1->s1;   // !! cause type merge, see redeclaration rules.
            // refer to case: variable_decl_def/global_decl_def_dfa/redecl_rules/normal_redecl
  s1->s2;   // !! local.alias = global, id in statement refers to the symbol in `globals' table.
            //    see implementation of idtree().

  variations:
  (1) s1: auto global
  (2) s1: static global

. extern local dfa
  s2->s2;  //  !! local type merge, symbol stores in `externals' table.
           //     there are two scenarios: the two extern locals within a function and not.
  s2->s1;  //  !! relocate

. external global redeclaration dfa
  please refer to redeclaration rules
  // refer to case: variable_decl_def/global_decl_def_dfa/redecl_rules/normal_redecl
