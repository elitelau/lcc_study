constant() function is called by 5 times:
   3 times from intconst();
                  |-- 2 times in listnodes(), when enter "case ARG:", with value 4 for size & align
                  |-- 1 times in docall(), for argoffset which with an even value maybe power of 2
                        with value 4 maybe.
   2 times from listnodes();  // there are CNST trees for line3, line9

   integer constant analysis:
   > 13: int, line3
     7:  int, line9
     4, 0: size & alignment of integer type, and argoffset

   > there is no u.c.loc is used, since cvtconst() is not used.
